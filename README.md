# 341-final

---

For my final project I want to make a website for my Production company, "The Cool Hat Brothers". My goal is to have a nice looking, functioning, and informative website that will tell you about productions that the company has done, hopes to do, and a little about ourselves.

![Basic breakdown](/img/IMG_1420.jpg)

This is my basic plan for the site, I'm sorry it doesnt look better. This is essentially what I want the pages to be. I want there to be the home page with the log, hich I have yet to make, and then an about page that has our "mission statement". I want a drop box for productions that we have done, or hope to do. Last I want a page for our conact info and maybe a place to sign up for a newsletter or something.
