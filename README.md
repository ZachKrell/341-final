For my final project I want to make a website for my Production company, "The Cool Hat Brothers". My goal is to have a nice looking, functioning, and informative website that will tell you about productions that the company has done, hopes to do, and a little about ourselves.

This is my basic plan for the site, I'm sorry it doesnt look better. This is essentially what I want the pages to be. I want there to be the home page with the logo, which I have yet to make, and then an about page that has our "mission statement". I want a drop box for productions that we have done, or hope to do. Last I want a page for our conact info and maybe a place to sign up for a newsletter or something. 



# I am so sorry

This is not my best work and I know it, I just got overwhelmed with school and other stuff, I didn't get to this assignment before it was too late, for a while I went through an existential crisis because I would rather turn nothing in than something bad. 
All and all I am glad I turned something in, I don't expect a good grade or even a passable one, I just want to put this out there and hopefuly get some points.

I am really sorry, I learned so much in this class, I was overwhelmed by a lot of it, but I perservered. Don't let this final fool you, I did work hard in the class, I just...was stupid and ran out of time.

I plan to work on my websites this summer, I want to be good at this I just don't know why I had such trouble with this site, other than not using my time wisely.

I am so dissapointed in myself, I hate that this is how i'm leaving this class. Thank-you, and again I am sorry.
